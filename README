The FolderPackager takes a directory of files and subdirectories and creates a PREMIS-based Submission Information Package (SIP).  The SIP is structured for ingest into our Fedora-based Medusa repository, but could be useful in other contexts as well, such as transfer between repositories.

The primary input to the packager is source directory name, plus settings specified in the app.config file.  

In addition to the packager and the plugins, this repository also includes several utility libraries that could be useful in other applications.  There is class library that wraps the FITS file characterization tool, and there is a class library for fetching collection MODS records from the Medusa collection registry.

NOTE: This project has dependencies on some of the libraries contained in the vs_ContentDMPackager repository.
